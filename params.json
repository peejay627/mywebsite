She was born in Alexandria, Virginia but spent most of her early life in Maryland.\r\nShe and her parents later moved to Oakland, California where she now resides.\r\nNiara describes herself as mostly shy and quiet around large crowds and people she doesn’t know, but is more eccentric and outgoing when you get to know her.\r\nIn her free time she enjoys drawing, reading, browsing the internet and playing games on her 3ds and laptop (like osul, even though she’s pretty bad at that one).\r\nHer favorite types of music are classical, electronic, some J-pop, alternative, and any combination of that, although she’ll listen to almost anything if she thinks it’s good. As somewhat of an author she likes to read and she is currently reading the Miss Peregrine series and Sailor Moon.\r\n</p>\r\n ",
