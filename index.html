<div>

Asantewaa is an ordinary 12 year old girl who dreams of becoming an animator. She was born in Alexandria, Virginia but spent most of her early life in Maryland.
She and her parents later moved to Oakland, California where she now resides.
Niara describes herself as mostly shy and quiet around large crowds and people she doesn’t know, but is more eccentric and outgoing when you get to know her.
In her free time she enjoys drawing, reading, browsing the internet and playing games on her 3ds and laptop (like osul, even though she’s pretty bad at that one).
Her favorite types of music are classical, electronic, some J-pop, alternative, and any combination of that, although she’ll listen to almost anything if she thinks it’s good. As somewhat of an author she likes to read and she is currently reading the Miss Peregrine series and Sailor Moon.
